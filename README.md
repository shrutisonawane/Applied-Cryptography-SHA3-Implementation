# Cryptography-SHA3
SHA-3 Implementation in JAVA

In October 2012, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) chose the Keccak algorithm as the new Secure Hash Algorithm-3 standard after a 5-year long Cryptographic Hash Algorithm competition and from among four other finalists. The SHA3 standard is applicable to all U.S. Federal departments and agencies for the protection of sensitive unclassified information, including being used as a component within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
Back in 2007, a number of weaknesses and attacks had been found on the predecessors of SHA-2 (i.e. on SHA-1 and MD-5), and hence it was feared that SHA-2 too, could soon be broken or exploited. Since specifying and defining a new government standard takes time, NIST decided to start its process of finding an apt SHA-3 algorithm, and finally chose Keccak in 2012.
